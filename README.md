# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-Green-

In this repo I solve data structures and algorithms for my coding course (Green level). The programming tasks consist of:
- Conditional statements
- Loop statements
- User defined functions
- Array
- Matrix
- String
- _Midterm contest_
- Recursion
- Data abstraction (struct/class)
- Sorting
- Singly Linked List
- Trees
- Graphs
- _Final Contest_
This repo also contains additional and personal practice problems from Codeforces and Codeforces rounds (Div. 3).
